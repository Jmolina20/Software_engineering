*Technologies used*

- HTML
- React
- Springboot
- MySQL
- Postman



*Purpose*

To list and rate the best spies in the world so that should you need a spy, you can now find them on an leaderboard where they're rated and listed with their special talents. The target end user would be your everyday manager in the CIA who's shopping around for a spy to use on the next mission. 


Unsolved Problems: 

Within Springboot, upon running it couldn't find one of the JPA repositories so any get request done via postman only returned a 404 error regardless of what url is typed.
